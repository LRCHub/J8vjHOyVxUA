[00:01.74] Hi
[00:13.00] How can I help you
[00:22.50] 
[00:14.58] Thanks for checking in
[00:15.34] I'm not doing well
[00:16.79] I'm the new face of management
[00:18.03] It's basically hell
[00:19.58] There's coffee on my shirt
[00:20.71] And burns on my arm
[00:23.46] I guess hot oil really hurts a lot
[00:24.55] Working overtime
[00:25.86] 'Cause someone called out
[00:27.22] And now we're running out of ice
[00:28.95] Can you tell me how
[00:29.93] To make everything worse
[00:31.12] The lights just went dark
[00:34.34] Oh won't you tell me when it's gonna stop
[00:36.40] Please step back
[00:39.41] If you keep yelling I am gonna have a panic attack
[00:41.71] Please understand
[00:46.02] Given the circumstances I'm doing the very best I can
[00:48.73] Smile baby smile for the corporation
[00:51.29] Vital baby vital to the operation
[00:54.08] Working for an hour costs as much as a sandwich
[00:55.27] There's gotta be more than this
[00:56.55] There's gotta be more than this
[00:59.20] Smile baby smile through the aggravation
[01:01.73] One day they'll appreciate your dedication
[01:04.44] Never ending orders and I don't have the bandwidth
[01:05.76] There's gotta be more than this
[01:07.19] There's gotta be more than this
[01:08.48] There's gotta be more than this
[01:20.30] There's gotta be more than this
[01:36.30] 
[01:21.39] Thanks for checking in
[01:22.86] The shit hit the shit
[01:23.84] A lot of money is missin'
[01:25.39] From during my shift
[01:26.69] There's ringing from the phone
[01:27.83] A call from my boss
[01:30.90] She said that corporate's gonna call the cops
[01:31.86] When the cops arrived
[01:33.09] I figured it out
[01:34.57] The totals in the safe were right
[01:35.99] I can't fucking count
[01:37.24] I'm desperate to go home
[01:38.50] But reading the clock
[01:41.41] Made me cry so hard that I need a mop
[01:43.99] Please look away
[01:46.61] I need a second to reset today I don't get a break
[01:48.92] Please let me go
[01:53.30] I'm out of sick days so I can't afford to break another bone
[01:55.83] Smile baby smile for the corporation
[01:58.65] Vital baby vital to the operation
[02:01.10] Working for an hour costs as much as a sandwich
[02:02.32] There's gotta be more than this
[02:03.82] There's gotta be more than this
[02:06.55] Smile baby smile through the aggravation
[02:09.02] One day they'll appreciate your dedication
[02:11.66] Never ending orders and I don't have the bandwidth
[02:12.80] There's gotta be more than this
[02:14.59] There's gotta be more than this
[02:15.55] There's gotta be more than this
[02:20.19] There's gotta be more than this
[02:21.89] I'm reaching my limit
[02:24.55] Red hot fever like a sickness
[02:26.84] At the maximum it's pain
[02:29.94] And at minimum it's rage
[02:32.14] I'm reaching my limit
[02:35.04] Red hot fever like a sickness
[02:37.38] At the maximum it's pain
[02:43.54] And at minimum it's rage
[02:47.21] I'm not gonna smile, fuck the corporation
[02:49.97] Cycle it's a cycle, not an operation
[02:52.52] All they're ever gonna do is take me for granted
[02:53.72] There's gotta be more than this
[02:55.24] There's gotta be more than this
[02:57.96] I'm not gonna smile through the aggravation
[03:00.47] They'll never appreciate my dedication
[03:02.99] Never ending orders that I think I'll abandon
[03:04.48] There's gotta be more than this
[03:05.72] There's gotta be more than this
[03:07.12] There's gotta be more than this
[03:19.62] I know that there's more
